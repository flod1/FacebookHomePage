## Installation using Composer

The easiest way to create a new Zend Framework project is to use
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).  If you don't have it already installed,
then please install as per the [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

To Install vendor:

```bash
$ composer update
```

Config Local Development on Virtual Host

```bash
SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "development"
```
